# QkScrpt
A quick script that runs two programs, automating a repetitive task.
I bound the .bat file to a Windows keyboard shortcut to further reduce time and complexity of the task.

The script checks to see if the requested program (in this case, autohotkey.exe) is already running. If it is not, it starts the specified AHK script, then runs the game program.

In my case, I only need one AHK script running
